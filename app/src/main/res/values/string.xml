        "Introduction:
        The idea of the game is very simple - to find and label a fixed number of mines which have been
        randomly distributed across a grid.\n

        When the game is started, the player is presented with a grid of blank squares. When a grid square is clicked on - it reveals the number of mines in adjacent squares(unless it's a mine, in which case it's game over). By using logic, players can in many ways use this information to find the squares without mines (or mine-filled),
        and proceed to click on additional squares to clear them or mark them with flag to indicate the presence of a mine. The game is over when abstract minefield is cleared
        from all mines, or in case the player clicks on the square with mine.

        There are 3 predefined difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, expert),
        which define how much mines player must find to win the game.

        tips:
        The player can place a flag graphic on any square believed to contain a mine.
        Special switch-button is used for switching to "Flag mode" (enables player to place flag).
        Press this button to enter or exit this mode. Squares marked with a flag can be cleared or added only in
        "Flag mode"."
